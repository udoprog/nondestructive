//! Support for non-destructive YAML editing.
//!
//! YAML is parsed with [`from_slice`], which returns a [`Document`]. Documents
//! are serialized through their [`std::fmt::Display`] and
//! [`Document::write_to`] implementations.
//!
//! With `serde` support enabled, [`Document`] can also be serialized through
//! [`serde`].
//!
//! ## Specification compliance
//!
//! This parser does not strictly adhere to the [YAML specification].
//!
//! In particular:
//! * We support any form of indentation, not just spaces.
//! * Neither input nor output is not required to be UTF-8.
//! * Keys in [Mappings][Mapping] can be anything, the only requirement is that
//!   they are succeeded by a colon (`:`).
//! * [Sequences][Sequence] can also be anything, everything after the `-` is
//!   used as a value.
//!
//! This means that we will validly parse both spec and non-spec compliant YAML.
//! They key here is that editing performed by this crate is non-destructive. So
//! if the source is spec compliant YAML, then we will produce spec compliant
//! YAML. If the source is **not** spec compliant YAML we will produce similarly
//! non-spec compliant YAML.
//!
//! If you want to ensure that valid YAML is produced, we recommend that you
//! enable the `serde` feature and use a crate such [`serde-yaml`]. But keep in
//! mind that it will not preserve the original structure of the document. See
//! the [`serde` module][serde] for how this is done.
//!
//! <br>
//!
//! ## Serde support
//!
//! Serde is supported for [`Document`] and [`Value`] through the `serde`
//! feature, see the [`serde` module][serde] for documentation.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```
//! use anyhow::Context;
//! use nondestructive::yaml;
//!
//! let doc = yaml::from_slice("32")?;
//! assert_eq!(doc.as_ref().as_u32(), Some(32));
//!
//! # Ok::<_, Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
//! ```
